## üßê Problem statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

The ideal scenario envisions a streamlined integration process with Bakrypt.io API for transforming digital assets into NFTs. The goal is to encapsulate common use cases with a React application, providing other integrations and applications with a preloaded solution that accelerates the integration with Bakrypt.io API. The desired outcome is an intuitive and efficient interface that simplifies minting tokens and enhances the overall user experience.

The goal is to create a standardized and efficient method for handling asset validation and file uploads across various widgets and endpoints. This approach will significantly reduce the time and effort required to upload files, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly experience for integrating platforms. By implementing a standardized mechanism, developers can focus on enhancing other aspects of the integration, leading to faster deployment and improved user satisfaction.

## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

Bak Bridge is a drop-in module for your users to preload, create and mint Cardano native tokens. This allows you to access their data using Bakrypt's API. Bak Bridge handles authentication, asset validation, transaction configuration and error handling.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development
and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

### `pnpm install`

Installs all the required libraries.

### `pnpm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `pnpm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `pnpm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
